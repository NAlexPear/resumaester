# ResuMaester
## The Resume-focused CLI


### What?

`ResuMaester` is here to help you compile, template, and serve your resume in a paper-less world. Share and update your resume as JSON or TOML, convert to PDF, HTML, or JSON, and serve the result to users through AWS Lambda, Netlify Functions, or Zeit Now.


### Why?

As you're setting out to forge new links in your Maester chain, you shouldn't have to spend time maintaining 5 different formats of multiple different resumes. Use the same data to compile your resume into different formats, beautifully themed as required, and served conveniently as a JSON API to consume, or as a static HTML page to view, or as a PDF to attach to applications or emails.
